# Project Management Job at Nifty Chess

# Front End Dev Contractor at Nifty Chess

## About

We're building Treasure Chess - an app that adds achievements, NFTs, trading cards, and a maretplace to the age old classic of chess. There are more possible games of chess than atoms in the universe and each game is collaborative work of art between two players.

We started Nifty Chess at the ETHDenver hackathon because Chess is having a huge cultural moment, and NFTs are the ideal way to preserve moments and games we care about. Our next iteration, called **Treasure Chess** will onboard millions of people to crypto.

## Why we are cool

We are building something really interactive, fun, and more interesting than big brands are making. Where other big brands like CNN's vault, essentially are just trying to auction off 1/many NFT _moments_ for as much as they can possibly can, we're building a platform reflects the ethos of crypto a lot more with a mega huge focus on UX

### How we're different:

UX:

- Users can log in with web2 account and be given an Ethereum address
- Runs on a scalable Layer2 network (sustainable: creating items uses similar electricity as sending an email)
- meta transactions mean we pay all the gas for users
- partnerships with huge brands but we still control future development

fair:

- Cost for users to enter is small if they choose, streamers with an audience have a new way to monetize their audience optionally
- users can opt-out

ethical:

- protections that limit how much people can ape in if they are new to NFTs
- specifically designed to limit gambling and choose engagement over addiction 

## What we need help with
We're managing a small team building a big app, with a lot of plans for V2 and a lot of things to organize to finish V1. We use GitHub Projects for managing tasks. Most of the tasks are turning designed componenets on figma into React componenets and implementing them in the app. Keeping track of the status of each componenet, tracking which devs are working on what, and making sure we are on track to hit our goals is a challenge you should help us with. 

This could be part time or full time contracting depending on commitment. But if you were really into it, and our team work feels great, we could talk about this being a potential co-founder role too.

## Requirements
- Programming skills not necesarily required, but a basic understanding of how our stack (react, web3, EVM) works will be really helpful
- Kanban experience 
- Can break down a larger task into specific GitHub issues for a dev
- Understand basics of NFTs. Or being willing to learn.
- You get it: when it comes to shipping crypto products aimed at normal people, we can build cool things that are higher impact per individual contributor than traditional apps, especially when we spend so much energy focusing on amazing UX
