# Front End Dev Contractor at Nifty Chess

## About

We're building Treasure Chess - an app that adds achievements, NFTs, trading cards, and a maretplace to the age old classic of chess. There are more possible games of chess than atoms in the universe and each game is collaborative work of art between two players.

We started Nifty Chess at the ETHDenver hackathon because Chess is having a huge cultural moment, and NFTs are the ideal way to preserve moments and games we care about. Our next iteration, called **Treasure Chess** will onboard millions of people to crypto.

## Why we are cool

We are building something really interactive, fun, and more interesting than big brands are making. Where other big brands like CNN's vault, essentially are just trying to auction off 1/many NFT _moments_ for as much as they can possibly can, we're building a platform reflects the ethos of crypto a lot more with a mega huge focus on UX

### How we're different:

UX:

- Users can log in with web2 account and be given an Ethereum address
- Runs on a scalable L2
- meta transactions mean we pay all the gas for users
- partnerships with huge brands but we still control future development

fair:

- Cost for users to enter is small if they choose, streamers with an audience have a new way to monetize it that is better than anything

ethical:

- protections that limit how much people can ape in if they are new to NFTs

## Requirements

We dont care about where you went to school or if you're self taught. If you can build, we respect you.

What we're looking for:

- Know your way around React, building components, and connecting components to the API. This is the main thing for this role.
- You _get it_: when it comes to shipping crypto products aimed at normal people, we can build cool things that are higher impact per individual contributor than traditional apps.
- Independent builder. We break down features in small manageable tasks, but both co-founders are also coding, so while we're always available for pair programming or debugging, getting through the tasks is individual effort on your own schedule.

### Super Bonus Points
- active web3 related example projects on github
- Used Redwoodjs before
- Graphql experience

### Comp
 Let's talk and come up with a rate that everyone thinks is fair. We can only do contractor roles, not full time employee, because of legal overhead for now. But this could change in the very near future.
